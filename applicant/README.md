# Applicant App

This is a simple react app.  In building this, I combined both the Bootstrap
cover page and Bootstrap sign in examples into one.  The Bootstrap sign in was
modified to be a React component that mounts into the cover page.  The
application is very simple, it simple accepts the proper input, and logs it out
to the Javascript console.

To run:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
Then visit http://localhost:8000/index.html
